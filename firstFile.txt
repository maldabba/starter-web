this is the first text file to add to the repository.

This is the second edition to the text.
Just some random text.... 
remember to pull before pushing


This is the third addition. Tracked files.
a command to know is [git ls-files] to track the files that are tracked.




This is the fourth paragraph. with every change to different files, the commit is done one by one where we need to commit, and re-add the files that we editted.

the git add [filename] command, this about the add as add a change not as add a file. so we need to do a git add everytime we edit a file....so after this text i need to do a git add [name of the file].
