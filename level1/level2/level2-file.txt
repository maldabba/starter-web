this is added in level two.


To rename a file using the bash mv not git mv. git will see it as two seprate operations. adding a file with a new name and  and Delete the file. for this we use $ mv [filename.txt newfilename.txt]. this will do outside of git. then we add it on git by $ git add -A. it will update files renamed, moved and deleted recursivly.

IT IS ALWAYS BETTER To do the renaming first, then do the changes in the file so it makes it easier for git to track the changes.
